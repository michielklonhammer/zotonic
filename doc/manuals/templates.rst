Actions
^^^^^^^

Attach AJAX and jQuery handlers to HTML elements and events.

Actions are the basis of all interactivity on a Zotonic web page.

Actions can be connected to HTML elements or Javascript events using the :ref:`scomp-wire` scomp.

Actions range from a simple jQuery :ref:`action-show` to Ajax :ref:`action-postback`\s that can trigger many other actions. The server also replies to a :term:`postback` or :term:`Comet` push with actions to be executed on the browser.

.. seealso:: listing of all :ref:`actions`.

Contributing documentation
==================================

For documentation, we encourage contributions to Zotonic from the
community even more!


We use git for documentation. For large documentation changed, you
should take the same approach as with :doc:`contributing`: e.g. create
a fork of Zotonic, create a topic branch, make the changes, push, pull
request.

However, for small changes, typo's, et cetera, Github provides a nice
edit button which you can use to edit these ``.rst`` files.

**FIXME** -- generate edit links for each RST file!, like this:

`Edit <https://github.com/zotonic/zotonic/edit/master/doc/dev/documentation.rst>`_

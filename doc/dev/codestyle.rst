Code style conventions
======================

.. note:: 
   As these conventions were established only after a large
   part of the codebase has been written, the code style described here
   is not yet in effect in all parts of the Zotonic code base. We're
   trying to gradually adapt to it, however.


Indenting Erlang code
---------------------

We use the "Emacs-style" indenting (using erlang-mode provided with the 
Erlang distribution). This indenting style seems to be a convention in much
of the Erlang world.


Indenting templates
-------------------

### explain how we do this and how we indent HTML vs. template tags? ###


Spaces versus tabs
------------------

We use spaces everywhere. One tab stop is equal to 4 spaces.

When writing code, do not introduce trailing whitespace and try to keep lines
of code shorter than 80 characters.


Writing Commit Messages
-----------------------

### taken from rebar's readme, https://github.com/basho/rebar; I find those quite sensible. ###

Structure your commit message like this::

  One line summary (less than 50 characters)

  Longer description (wrap at 72 characters)

* The summary should be less than 50 characters, and tell what was
  changed. Use the imperative present tense (fix, add, change). For
  example: `Add 'foobar' filter`, `Fix bug in media upload service`.

* The description should explain the intention and implementation of
  your approach, in the present tense.

*  When your commit fixes a bug on github, add `Fixes #1545` on a separate line below the description.

Notice the empty line preceeding the longer description.


Atomicity
---------

* Break up logical changes into separate commits.

* Make whitespace changes separately.
